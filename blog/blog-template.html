      Notice that we have three stylesheet links: the first two are for the Skeleton framework,
      and the final one is for any custom styles we might need, like turning the background
      bright pink.

      Please don't make the background pink... have a little pity on your teachers!

          <p>A responsive site is a website which <em>responds</em> differently to different-sized windows or displays. The layout will adjust depending on what sized screen or device it is being displayed on.</p>

          <p>Mobile-first design is starting the design process with the mobile version of a site. Because of the size of mobile phone screens, space is a premium. This allows the person designing the page to focus just on what elements are the most important. From there, more elements and more design features can be added as larger screen sizes allow.</p>

          <p>A framework is a package of standardized code documents that can be used as a foundation or template on which to build a website. For example, this website has been recently rebuilt using the Skeleton framework.</p>

          <p>There are pros and cons to using a framework. Using a framework speeds up the mock-up process, provides clean and tidy code, can be helpful in collaborative work since everyone is working from the same protocol, and browser compatbility is already included. However it can slow the learning curve for new developers, as you're not learning to do everything yourself.</p>

          <p>A wireframe is a very simple drawing of your website. It doesn't incorporate any real design features, just the basic elements of the page and where you want them. We use the wireframe as a reference point, a blueprint. It helps us to establish a hierarchy of all our elements and the information therein.</p>

          <img class="u-max-full-width" src="../images/wireframe-index-page-desktop.jpeg" alt="Wireframe of Homepage continued">

          <p>Here you can see my wireframe drawings for the index page of this website. I haven't worked out yet how to add a search bar and position it over the main image yet. I also haven't been able to set the nav bar quite how I would like it either. It seems that I have to have all my blog posts linked to my main page, but for now I'm ok with that.</p>

          <img class="u-max-full-width" src="..\images\wireframe-blog-page-desktop.jpeg" alt="Wireframe of Blog pages">

          <p>This is the wireframe for my blog pages. Since all my blog links are the top of the page, I decided to leave off having the sidebar for now.</p>

          <p>Because the Skeleton framework is actually quite close to what I wanted for my site anyway, I have applied it to all the pages of my site for now. I have a bit of work to do on my CSS as well.</p>
