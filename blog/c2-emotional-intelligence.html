          <p>Reading the first chapter of <em>Search Inside Yourself</em>, I found the part about the top six competencies for people working in tech quite surprising. I honestly wouldn't have expected the emotional competencies to be so highly valued - at least not prior to staring at EDA.</p>

          <p>The concept of happiness as a trainable skill was really interesting to me. It's kind of reassuring though, the idea that you can become a happier person without actually needing to change anything about your situation. You don't need to control everything going on around you, because you can control what's going on inside. That's pretty cool.</p>

          <p>I found the part about physiological responses to emotions very relatable. I get quite severe dyshidrotic eczema on my hands and it took me a long time to figure out what was triggering it. Turns out it's stress and/or anxiety. Eventually I realised the worst outbreaks were coming about eight to ten hours after moments of intense stress. So for me, the physical cues aren't so much a way for me to monitor my feelings, but being more aware of my feelings could help me avoid unwanted physical responses.</p>

          <p>My first attempt at two minutes of mindfulness was pretty laughable to be honest. I'm so easily distracted, I spent most of the two minutes bringing my attention back to my breathing. I started reading <em>Search Inside Yourself</em> a couple of weeks ago, so I've been working on mindfulness regularly since then. I set a meditation timer for seven minutes, with a bell sound at every minute, and I do it several nights a week before bed. Now I can keep my mind completely blank and "simply be" for a full minute before my mind starts to wander again. The bell sound at the end of every minute help me to both measure my own progress, and serve as a reminder to come back if my attention has drifted somewhere else.</p>

          <p>I've noticed since making mindfulness a regular practice, that my sleep quality has improved significantly. I usually wake up to go to the bathroom two or three times a night; it's always been that way for me. Since I've been making a point of meditating most nights before bed, I'm only waking up once a night, sometimes sleeping right through (which can be quite disconcerting when you're not used to it). Although I suppose this could also be a result of being totally worn out!</p>
