          <p>I had to have a wee laugh at myself when reading through this part. I think a lot of us chase after pleasure without even really thinking about how harmful it can be for us, so when we do think about it, we feel guilty and that's not great either. I hope it's not just me anyway! Actually, while checking in with my meditation buddy recently, we talked about something similar to this. We were talking about things that we enjoy, and that are good for us, but for some reason we struggle to actually make time for them. For both of us, meditation was one of those things. We enjoy it, we know the benefits that can be had from it, we know that we'll feel better for having done it, but for some reason it's really easy to fall out of the habit. I feel that way about exercise - while I don't particularly enjoy actually doing it, I love how I feel afterwards, it's good for me in so many different ways, but doing nothing feels really good too and requires no effort whatsoever. And I <em>know</em> that that doing-nothing-pleasure-high will diasppear, and that I'll feel worse for it, it's still hard to fight.</p>

          <p>My core values, and what I stand for... that's pretty hefty. I'm going to try and keep it as short and simple as possible. Recognising and addressing social inequality, integrity, open-mindedness, sustainability...these are things that are important to me which <em>I wish were also a priority for everyone else on the planet</em>. That's how I would define my core values.</p>

          <p>100% did not enjoy the resilience exercise. I definitely lean more towards the pessimistic in this case and struggled to bring to mind a "moment of significant success - having exceeded my goal". I can recall times when <em>others</em> were proud of me, but I can be quite hard on myself and often question whether I am deserving of that kind of praise or ackowledgement. Being more optimistic towards myself is an on-going project.</p>

          <p>I found the part about the Zappos customer service team really interesting - particularly where it mentioned they get even higher service ratings than Four Seasons Hotel staff. It kind of blew my mind a little because I've stayed at a Four Seasons and was <em>completely amazed</em> by the level of service - so much so that I've actually raved to people about it. So I figure the Zappos team must be something pretty special.</p>
