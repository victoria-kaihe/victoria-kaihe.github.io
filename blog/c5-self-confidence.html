          <p>Self-awareness and mindfulness are very similar; both are a state of reflection, awareness, and being present.</p>

          <p>Both the body scan and journalling are practices that I'm familiar with. I often use the Stop, Breathe, Think app for guided meditation. A session begins with assessing your feelings, then plugging those into the app. It feeds back recommended meditation sessions to choose from, then when you're done, you enter how you're feeling post-meditation. The suggested meditations almost always include a body scan which can last for eight minutes or seventeen minutes. Whatever session(s) I choose, I usually end with a body scan. I almost always feel better afterwards - I have to be really riled up for it not help me feel more relaxed.</p>

          <p>Journaling and I have a long history together; I've been doing it on and off since I was a kid. I remember the first journal I had - it was small, pocket-sized, it had a fluffy purple cover dotted with silver threads and a flimsy lock. I would have been about nine or ten years old. I have a box stashed away in a cupboard somewhere that contains diaries spanning my teenage years, through to early adulthood, when I started university, and met my current partner seven years ago. I stopped journaling for years after that - the longest I've been without since I first started. I picked it up again just over a year ago. I'm still irregular with the practice, but I do find a kind of solace in it. I always feel a bit more in tune with myself afterwards, as well as mentally and emotionally lighter. To me it's kind of like a guilt-free offload, because I don't have burden someone else with my excess, and I don't even have to make sense.</p>


          <p>When Meng talks about being able to experience feelings mindfully, I think I understand what he means because that's kind of my way of managing an enxiety attack. When it happens, I find that most effective way <em>for me</em> to get through is to acknowledge what I'm feeling, to tell myself that it's ok for me to feel this way, that my feelings are valid, keep breathing, and to keep reminding myself that <em>it will pass</em> - then just ride it out.</p>
