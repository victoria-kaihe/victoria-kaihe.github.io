          <p>The 'process over product' concept definitely made the whole redesign/rebuild less overwhelming. It made it easier for me to step back and look at it bit by bit, instead of trying to do too many things at once and getting frustrated. It felt less chaotic.</p>

          <hr>

          <p>I had read a few articles here and there about meditation before reading <em>Search Inside yourself</em>, so I already had a vague understanding of it and that it was something we should probably all be doing. I tried it a few times, but it was never a priority and I was discouraged by how easily distracted I was - something I now know is a completely normal part of the process.</p>

          <hr>

          <p>I've learned to think of meditation in the same way as physical exercise - the more you do it, the fitter you become. I don't know if this will actually help me to practice more regularly, since I'm pretty rubbish at making an effort to do regular physical exercise as well, but it still strikes me as a good way to think about it. I suppose it's because we all <em>know</em> that exercise is good for our bodies, but because meditation is a somewhat abstract concept it can be a little harder to grasp how it's beneficial.</p>

          <p>The real, measurable effects of meditation on psoriasis was really awesome for me to read! As someone who has eczema, this was potentially fantastic news. I know stress is one trigger for my breakouts, so it will be interesting to see whether regular meditation helps to limit those episodes.</p>

          <p>It was also super encouraging to learn that it's completly normal and ok for my attention to wander when I'm practicing my meditation!</p>

          <p>Using imagery in conjuction with my breathing rhythm stood out to me. A picture that I like to hold in my mind while I'm meditating is a beach at home in the Abel Tasman National Park - drawing my breath in with the water pulling back from the shore, and exhaling with the waves as they wash in. I also quite liked the idea of "sitting like a mountain", which brought to mind my <em>maunga, awa, waka, </em> and the rhythm of paddle strokes through the water.</p>

          <p>Final takeaway from this chapter - I like Meng's sense of humour.</p>
