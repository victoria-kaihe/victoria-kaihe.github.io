        <p>The DBC/EDA experience definitely seems to be unique compared with other learning institutes - in every way that I can think of. When I think of my time at university, and compare that with what I've read/seen/heard about EDA, they could hardly be more different. For the most part, I enjoyed my time at uni - but I didn't learn how to get a job in my field of study, I didn't learn what working in that field was like, I didn't even get to know any of my classmates until my second year.</p>

        <p>The impression that I first got of EDA from reading through the site, and watching other people's testimonies of their time here was a strong one. I got the feeling that if they would have me, it would be one of the hardest things I'd ever do, but also hugely rewarding. I thought, "Heres a place that understands why diversity is important, that doesn't just want to teach code, but <em>how to be a coder</em> out in the real world. Here is a place where I'll be expected to bring everything I have, and in return my peers, my tutors will do the same." This impression hasn't changed.</p>

        <p>Even though the culture of EDA was a big draw for me, I do still expect to face some challenges with it. I think I often come across more extroverted than I am, so during Phase 0 I need to be mindful that I'm not withdrawing into my own little bubble, and during Phase 1 I need to make sure I'm aware of my limits of social interaction and communicate those needs so I don't burn myself out.</p>

        <p>My expectations of EDA haven't changed at all. I'm very excited to be participating in this kind of learning environment - nervous too. It's very different from anything else I've ever done and I'm 100% new to coding so - excited and nervous in equal measures.</p>
