          <p>I didn't try the empathic listening, but Meng's story about making a woman cry during the exercise brought to mind an incident at my work last year. I worked on a children's TV show and answered directly to the production manager, and the production coordinator, then indirectly to the two executive producers - one of whom owned the company, but lived in the South Island. One week, the usual executive producer was on leave, so the "big boss" was in town to cover. At the same time, the production manager experienced a family tragedy and was off for the whole week. This meant that very suddenly, the production coordinator and I were dealing directly with the owner of the company on a daily basis - not an easy thing, let me tell you. She's a difficult woman to be around at the best of times, but she decided that she didn't like the way things seemed to be operating without her constant presence in Auckland, and she was on a warpath to sort things out. Come Friday, everyone was wrung out, but I'd noticed that the production coordinator had copped it the worst out of all of us. So while I was out doing my usual errands, I bought a small cake, and left it on her desk. When she got back from her lunch break she came out of her office and asked if I knew about the beautiful little cake on her desk. I told her, "I got it while I was picking up those cake mixes for Justin. I know you've had a shitty week and I saw the cake and just thought you deserved to end the week on a high note, even if it was just a small one." She started pouring her heart out to me and I could see that she was trying not to cry. It ended up being a really solidifying moment in our working relationship; once she knew that someone saw and understood when she was struggling in the workplace, she didn't feel like she had to deal with it alone anymore.</p>

          <p>The loving kindness was a bit of a surprise to me, because it's similar to something I've been trying to do for some years now. Nothing so structured or formal as an actual meditation practice, but I have been learning to let go of my assumptions about people and not to make snap, negative judgements about strangers. For example, when I see another driver doing something stupid, instead of getting angry, I try to remind myself that I know nothing about that person beyond that one mistake. They could be new to their restricted license and not very confident yet, there could be a distraction in their car like a noisey child; whatever it is, me being angry at a stranger doesn't serve anyone so maybe I should let it go. I suppose I could extend the practice to people I actively dislike or "who create a lot of dofficulty in my life", but I tend to not allow those people a place in my life wherever possible.</p>

          <p>The situation for this political awareness exercise happened when I was working in a government department in 2016...</p>

          <p><em>It has occured to me that there is probably no need for the staff in this office to work the set hours that we do. The nature of the work is the same as that at my previous office, and we were allowed to choose our start and finish times. I would love to be able to start work earlier, so that I can finish earlier, which would allow me a better work/life balance. I also don't need an hour lunch break, half an hour is enough for me. If I feel this way, there are probably others who feel the same - people who could benefit from different hours by being able to avoid traffic, or take their children to and from school more easily and so save money on before- and after-school care. Our work is timebound only by the hours during which the programme in which we process payments is online - our clients do not need us to be here specifically between the hours of 0830 and 1700. We are not client-facing, we do not take inbound calls, we make very few outbound calls. We work on cases retrospectively; our work does not (or should not) disrupt a client's weekly payments. When processing a case, it is easy to place on hold should we need assistance from a manager or a member of the quality assurance team. A manager is required to be onsite, but there are managers in the downstairs office from 0700, which is before our programmes come online anyway. Health and safety requires there be at least two people in the office at any given time, so as long as more than one person is interested in working any given time-slot, that shouldn't be an issue. This unit even has added system we didn't use at my previous office, which notes when we log in, when we pick up a case, how long we work on it, when we close it and pick up a new one, and when we log out for breaks. I have discussed the possibility of flexible working hours with the new head of our unit, and he has said that he is open to the improvement of work/life balance. I have let him know that I will speak to my union members, to gauge interest in the idea of flexible hours, as this will likely give a good indication of overall staff interest - then I will get back to him to talk about whether it is worth pursuing.</em></p>

          <p>I will do my best to complete the second half of this exercise seriously, but given the way the other side reacted to the situation, there will almost definitely be some sarcasm.</p>

          <p><em>This union rep has asked about whether flexible working hours could be implimented here. I want to make a good impression here so I will appear open and hear her out. She has presented solutions to all of management's concerns, but I don't think she really understands what she's asking us to do. I don't know the staff in this unit and this kind of set-up would require a lot of trust on my part, and the managers', and I don't think it would be fair of me to ask that of my management team. Besides, this isn't a priority for me, I have more important people to impress in this new job. It doesn't matter anyway, the union isn't very strong here and she'll lose interest, so I probably won't have to do anything about this.</em></p>

          <p>For the record, they did have to do something about it.</p>

          <p>I found Patrick Lencioni's dysfunctional pyramid kind of hilarious because looking back, that pyramid reflects <em>exactly</em> how things worked at my old job. Kind of a depressing thought, huh?</p>
