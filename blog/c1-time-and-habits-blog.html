    <h3>Time and Habit Reflections</h3>
    <p>The idea of breaking down goals into small, achievable chunks totally resonated with me, it's something I've actually been working at for the last few months. I dabble on and off with <a href="http://bulletjournal.com/">bullet journaling</a>, which I find really helpful in setting and achieving goals. At the start of each month, I set up a basic calendar for that month - dates and days listed down the side, adding any events, appointments, or notes for the appropriate days. Then I set up a page for things I want to achieve by the end of the month. This never takes up more than half a page, so I use the bottom half to reflect on last month's goals, what went well, what didn't, and if it didn't go well, is it worth continuing? At the start of the week I do the same thing again - plan out what I need to do that week to make progress towards that month's goals. Each day, for a few minutes in the morning I do it on an even smaller scale again - what am I going to do <em>today</em> to chip away at this iceberg? At the end of the day I'll spend a little time going over the day, how I feel about it, how I feel going forward. It all probably sounds like it takes up a lot of time, but it's really only a few minutes here and there, and for me, it really does help make everything more manageable.</p>

    <p>I find the Pomodoro technique very interesting, especially as someone who gets distracted very easily. I struggle with focused meditation, but it's something I want to work on because I like the idea of being able to completely quiet my brain down and not think about anything. When I read about the moving mediation in <em>Search Inside Yourself</em>, they used the example of walking and I couldn't really get my head around it, because I think <strong>a lot</strong> when I walk. I didn't really understand how I could walk along and only think, "Lifting, lifting, lifting, moving, moving, moving." I just didn't get it.</p>

    <p>Then when I was reading through the time and habit resources, there was a little cartoon of a woman knitting under "moving meditation" and this lightbulb went off in my head. That's exactly what knitting is for me, I just never realised it. My mum is amazing at knitting, she does it while she watches TV, needles flying, not even looking at what she's doing. I can't do that. I don't knit very often, so when I do, I only think about the movements as I'm doing them.</p>

    <p><em>In, around, under, off</em></p>
    <p><em>In, around, under, off</em></p>
    <p><em>In, around, under, off</em></p>

    <p>Since I already know that breaking goals down into small, manageable chunks works for me, I will definitely continue to do that. Based on this, I think the Pomodoro technique will work nicely for me, so I'd like to try that. Also, now that I know I can use knitting as a way of meditating, I can start using that as another way of practicing mindfulness while being creative.</p>
