          <p>So my sister called me like the same day that I read Chapter Three of <em>Search Inside Yourself</em>, with a lot that she needed to get off her chest so she was the perfect person to do this exercise with. Since she obviously had a lot on her mind, I actually let her go well over three minutes - until she'd said everything she needed to say. Afterwards, she said she really appreciated knowing that whenever she paused, I hadn't drifted off or was gotten distracted doing something else, I was just giving her space to gather her thoughts into a coherent rant.</p>

          <hr>

          <p>I liked the suggestion of having an accountabili-buddy. I had a really great conversation with a friend recently about meditation and mindfulness, and how she  wanted to get back into it. So I sent her a message asking if she'd be interested in checking in with each other and she was all for it! She's started reading <em>Search Inside Yourself</em> now too and we're having our first check-in this week.</p>

          <hr>

          <p>I'm going to take on the advice of doing less than you can. I often expect too much of myself too soon, and get frustrated when I feel like I've failed. I quite enjoy Meng's analogies - in this chapter I found the meditation/sleep analogy particularly relatable.</p>

          <p>I've started Meng's practice of mindful eating this week. I've just started a ketogenic diet as a little experiment. I hear a lot of people rave about the mental clarity and focus they feel when in ketosis, which appeals to me since I'm studying again. There are a lot of foods that I can't really eat while I'm doing this, and there are very strict macronutrient requirements that I have to meet - so all of my meals are very carefully measured and thought out. This, in addition with the smaller sizes of my meals (because they are very high in fat), helps me to be more aware and appreciate what I am eating.</p>
