          <p>Pretty much anything not going the way I expect it to causes a disporportionate emotional response while programming. Mostly though it happens when I think I'm following a very clear instruction, exactly as it says, and whatever is supposed to happen doesn't. I have this instant moment of panic, quickly followed by a pause wherein I tell myself <em>not</em> to panic because I probably just misspelled something, or forgot to close a bracket somewhere, or something very simple and easily remedied. Not immediately understanding an instruction also causes me to overreact a bit. If I don't understand straight away my brain immediately goes to a place of, "How am I supposed to do the thing if I don't actually understand what I'm supposed to be doing??" In these two cases, the solution is usually just to step back a little, and if that doesn't work then there's always, you know - asking for help.</p>

          <p>I think the memory I chose for the Siberian North Railroad exercise was still a little too fresh in my mind, because I had to keep going back to Stop, Breathe - every time I tried to Reflect I could feel myself start to spiral. I did manage to take note of where why feelings were physically manifesting, so hopefully with more practice I can get through the whole process.</p>
