      bright pink.

      Please don't make the background pink... have a little pity on your teachers!

          <p>I'm going to level with you, non-tech friend. I don't think I've ever solved a tech problem elegantly - at least I can't think of a time. I've solved real-life problems elegantly, but so far no tech ones. I did have a problem in this sprint - a very simple it turned out. I was following the step-by-step instructions, this function I was writing should have worked but wasn't. I didn't understand why. It was almost a copy-and-paste job. I tried changing a few things about the code, I compared what I'd written with the examples, then I used a checker to see if my syntax was off. As far as I could tell, it <em>should</em> have been working. It seemed like it had to be a simple problem, I just wasn't seeing something. So I got up and made some food, came back, looked at it again, and thought, "Huh...I think that word's wrong. I'll be so pissed if that's what was wrong." It was exactly what was wrong. I was just using the wrong variable name. Go figure.</p>

          <p>It was ridiculously frustrating, and I learned that most of errors probably aren't a big deal and I should stop over-complicating them.</p>

          <p>I haven't tried pseudocoding yet, but it seems to be a pretty valuable tool and I do want to start using it. Trying something is usually the first thing I do, then if it doesn't work, at least I have a starting point. I haven't tried the rubber ducky yet, but I've seen it work from <em>being</em> the rubber ducky haha so I'll probably give it a go sometime. I'll use my cats.</p>

          <p>I get a lot of error messages so I'm getting pretty comfortable with these. Google has been a good friend there. Console.logging is still a little bit of a msytery to me but it's slowly becoming clearer...I think. So far, everything with JavaScript feels like I'll be starting to grasp something and then the next minutes it's like, "NO YOU WERE WRONG SO VERY VERY WRONG SHAME ON YOU." Google is often my friend. Asking my peers and coaches for help is usually not near the top of my list, mostly because of all the insecurities that we all have and are trying to work on, but also because I can usually get an answer from Google pretty quickly. I could definitely stand to reflect a little more often.</p>
